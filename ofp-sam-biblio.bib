  Abstract                 = {A research programme was carried out in French Polynesia to study tuna behaviour using acoustics and fishing experiments. Acoustics are of great importance for the study of tuna behaviour and estimation of abundance but estimates of individual target strength that are available are particularly inaccurate. In this study, four yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and two bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) of weight 4-50 kg were individually caught, identified, and equipped with ultrasonic tags for telemetry experiments. While tracking the fish, simultaneous underwater acoustic data were recorded with a split-beam echosounder in order to estimate their in situ acoustic target strength. It was observed that target strength was stronger when fish were diving than when they were ascending toward the surface. This can be explained by the tilt angle orientation of the swimbladder. A target strength bias according to depth was also observed.},

  Abstract                 = {The retrospective problem involves systematic differences in sequential population analysis (SPA) estimates of stock size or some other quantity in a reference year. The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Length and age at maturity are important life history parameters for estimating spawning stock biomass and reproductive potential of fish stocks. Bias in estimates of size and age at maturity can arise when disparate distributions of mature and immature fish within a population are not accounted for in the analysis. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal variability in observed size and age at maturity of female albacore tuna, <italic>Thunnus alalunga</italic>, using samples collected across the South Pacific. Maturity status was identified using consistent histological criteria that were precise enough to allow for mature but regenerating females to be distinguished from immature females during the non-spawning season, permitting year-round sampling for maturity estimation in albacore. Using generalised linear mixed models, we found that the proportion of mature females at length varied significantly with latitude and time of year. Specifically, females at northern latitudes (10E0?E??S, where spawning occurs) were mature at significantly smaller lengths and ages than females at southern latitudes (?E??20?E0?E??S), particularly during the spawning season (October�March). This variation was due to different geographic distributions of mature and immature fish during the year. We present a method for estimating an unbiased maturity ogive that takes into account the latitudinal variation in proportion mature at length during a given season (spawning or non-spawning). Applying this method to albacore samples from the western region of the South Pacific gave a predicted length at 50% mature of 87 cm fork length (4.5 years).</p>},

Evaluation of a fishing captain's ability to predict species composition, sizes, and quantities of tunas associated with drifting fish-aggregating devices in the eastern Pacific Ocean. ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu012.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate a fishing captain's ability to predict species composition, sizes, and quantities of tunas associated with drifting fish-aggregating devices (FADs), before encirclement with a purse-seine net. Operating in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, during 11 May - 23 July 2011, Captain Ricardo Diaz detected small quantities of bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas within large FAD-associated aggregations dominated by skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). The captain's predictions were significantly related to the actual total catch and catch by species, but not to size categories by species. His predictions of species composition were most accurate when estimates of bigeye and yellowfin tuna were combined. If purse-seine captains are able to make accurate predictions of the proportion of bigeye and yellowfin tunas present in mixed-species aggregations associated with FADs, managers may wish to consider incentives to fishers to reduce the fishing mortality on those species.},

  Abstract                 = {Over 50% of the total bigeye tuna (BET) landed in the Western Central Pacific Ocean is caught incidentally in the purse seine fishery and sold for canning at prices less than US$2/kg. The remainder is landed in longline fisheries directed at BET and sold as fresh or frozen tuna at prices greater than US$10/kg. The combined fishing mortality by all gears will soon reduce the BET biomass in the Pacific Ocean to less than that capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. Closure of the high-seas enclaves in 2009 was hailed as a conservation measure, but was not scientifically evaluated before implementation and appears to have had no beneficial effect on the BET stock. A spatially explicit age-structured ecosystem model, SEAPODYM, is used to simulate alternative area-based fishery management policies to conserve bigeye tuna in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. Closing the high-seas enclaves to purse seine fishing has negligible effect on the BET biomass. Fishery management policies that control mortality on both juveniles and adults, through prohibition of fish aggregation devices in the purse seine fishery and restrictions on longline fishing in spawning areas, are the most efficient conservation policies. Large-scale benefits from bigeye conservation measures will become apparent only in the 2030s, assuming timely implementation and minimal effects of climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {We assess the performance of circle hooks, which are promoted as a measure for improving the survival of marine turtles following interactions with pelagic longlines. We conducted experiments off eastern Australia on commercial fishing vessels that alternated circle hooks (mostly size 14/0) and Japanese tuna hooks along their longlines. Most animals were hooked in the lip or jaw, regardless of hook type. There was no difference in the mean size of animals caught on the two types of hook, except for striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax), which tended to be larger on tuna hooks. Most species had an equal or lower probability of being alive on circle hooks than tuna hooks. Catch rates on circle hooks exceeded those on tuna hooks for most species. These included several target species, such as albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and striped marlin, and bycatch, including several shark species. The differences in catch rates were large enough to increase total catches and financial returns. The financial benefits of increased catches outweighed the costs of converting to circle hooks. The results indicate that the adoption of small circle hooks by longliners will not be detrimental to financial returns. },

  Abstract                 = {The interspecific preferences of fishes for different depths and habitats suggest fishers could avoid unwanted catches of some species while still effectively targeting other species. In pelagic longline fisheries, albacore (Thunnus alalunga) are often caught in relatively cooler, deeper water (>100 m) than many species of conservation concern (e.g., sea turtles, billfishes, and some sharks) that are caught in shallower water (<100 m). From 2007 to 2011, we examined the depth distributions of hooks for 1154 longline sets (3,406,946 hooks) and recorded captures by hook position on 2642 sets (7,829,498 hooks) in the American Samoa longline fishery. Twenty-three percent of hooks had a settled depth <100 m. Individuals captured in the 3 shallowest hook positions accounted for 18.3% of all bycatch. We analyzed hypothetical impacts for 25 of the most abundant species caught in the fishery by eliminating the 3 shallowest hook positions under scenarios with and without redistribution of these hooks to deeper depths. Distributions varied by species: 45.5% (n = 10) of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), 59.5% (n = 626) of shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), 37.3% (n = 435) of silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), and 42.6% (n = 150) of oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus) were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Eleven percent (n = 20,435) of all tuna and 8.5% (n = 10,374) of albacore were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Hook elimination reduced landed value by 1.6 - 2%, and redistribution of hooks increased average annual landed value relative to the status quo by 5-1.7%. Based on these scenarios, redistribution of hooks to deeper depths may provide an economically feasible modification to longline gear that could substantially reduce bycatch for a suite of vulnerable species. Our results suggest that this method may be applicable to deep-set pelagic longline fisheries worldwide.Compensaciones entre Captura, Captura Accesoria y Valores Asentados en la Pesquera de L�nea Larga de Samoa Americana},

  Abstract                 = {Large reductions in the abundance of exploited land predators have led to significant range contractions for those species. This pattern can be formalized as the range-abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that has important implications for the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2% and 46% loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11-29% increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three species of bluefin tuna and several marlin species. In contrast, skipjack tuna, which may have increased its abundance in the Pacific, has also expanded its range size. These results mirror patterns described for many land predators, despite considerable differences in habitat, mobility, and dispersal, and imply ecological extirpation of heavily exploited species across parts of their range.},
